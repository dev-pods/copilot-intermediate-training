# Demo Guide: Leveraging GitHub Copilot for Repository Analysis and Logging Enhancements

This guide walks you through a step-by-step demo for engineers on how to analyze a repository, enhance logging functionality, and estimate the Level of Effort (LOE) using GitHub Copilot. The demo is structured to simulate onboarding as a new engineer and using GitHub Copilot effectively.

---

## Prerequisites
1. **VS Code Setup**:
   - Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
   - Clone the [Microsoft VS Code Repository](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode).
   - Install the [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) extension.

2. **Required Extensions**:
   - GitHub Copilot
   - GitHub Copilot Chat

3. **Familiarity with Commands**:
   - Basic understanding of how to use `@workspace` commands in Copilot Chat.
   - Ability to navigate repository structures.

---

## Demo Structure
The demo consists of three tasks:

1. **Repository Analysis**
2. **Enhancing Logging Functionality**
3. **Estimating Level of Effort (LOE)**

---

## Task 1: Repository Analysis
### Objective:
Gain a thorough understanding of the repository structure and locate key files for logging.

### Steps:
1. Open the repository in VS Code.
2. Access advanced settings:
   - Open the **Extensions** panel.
   - Click on the Copilot gear icon and select **Settings**.
   - Edit the JSON configuration as needed.
3. Use `@workspace` commands to explore the repository:
   - Command 1: `@workspace With this being the first time looking at this repository, is there anywhere specific I should pay attention to?`
   - Command 2: `@workspace If I wanted to work on improving logging, where would that file be?`
4. Leverage Copilot Chat to identify libraries/frameworks:
   - Command: `@workspace Are there any logging libraries or frameworks in use by the src/vs/platform/log/common/log.ts file?`
5. Review logging coverage and style:
   - Command: `@workspace Can you talk to me about the logging coverage and style used across the application?`

---

## Task 2: Enhance Logging Functionality
### Objective:
Improve the logging mechanism by adding timestamps and log levels for better traceability.

### Steps:
1. Open `src/vs/platform/log/common/log.ts` in VS Code.
2. Review the current logging implementation:
   - Ask Copilot: `How would you improve the open file to include timestamps?`
3. Suggest potential enhancements:
   - Command: `@workspace How would you enhance the log.ts file to account for log levels and timestamps?`
4. Explain how Copilot uses references in `log.ts` to provide context-aware solutions.

---

## Task 3: Estimating Level of Effort (LOE)
### Objective:
Estimate the development time, complexity, and risks of implementing the proposed logging enhancements.

### Steps:
1. Understand the scope of enhancements:
   - Command: `@workspace What additional changes might be required to implement log levels and timestamps in log.ts?`
2. Assess dependencies:
   - Command: `@workspace Can you identify the dependencies for src/vs/platform/log/common/log.ts?`
3. Evaluate external tools:
   - Command: `Are there existing integrations with external logging tools in this repository? Would any new tools require additional configuration?`
4. Estimate development time:
   - Command: `How long might it take to implement log levels and timestamps for logging?`
5. Highlight technical risks and dependencies:
   - Command: `What are the risks of modifying logging in log.ts? Could this affect other parts of the application?`
6. Summarize findings:
   - Command: `Summarize the development effort required for these logging enhancements, highlighting risks and dependencies.`

---

## Summary
By following this guide, you will:
- Analyze the repository structure using GitHub Copilot and `@workspace` commands.
- Enhance logging functionality with specific improvements like timestamps and log levels.
- Estimate the Level of Effort (LOE) for proposed changes, including time, risks, and dependencies.

This demonstration showcases the power of GitHub Copilot in streamlining engineering workflows and solving complex tasks efficiently. For further clarification or questions, feel free to use Copilot Chat to dig deeper into specific nuances of the repository.
